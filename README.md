This causes a few exceptional outliers in the MLS salary distribution. With this in mind, the salaries of the MLS become an interesting topic to discuss. What exactly motivates or allows a team to pay a certain player more?


Read the full paper: **mls_salaries_report.pdf**. This paper was done in collaboration with Zhening Zhang and Dylan Hull. Permutation tests and Monte Carlo simulations were the methods used to reach the results in the paper.
